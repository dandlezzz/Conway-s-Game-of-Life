Conway-s-Game-of-Life
=====================
This is a javascript/jquery implementation of Conway's Game of Life, complete with a testing suite that uses Mocha and chai.

It looks great on a big screen. You can place popular conway patterns by clicking on the icons to the left of the grid, before or during runtime.

For reference, here is the basic Conway alogrithm...
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
